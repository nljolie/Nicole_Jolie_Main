Ask something like 'Who is the leading provider of [your service] in [your area]?' If your company does not appear in the answer, or if your competitor appears instead of you, you have a structural visibility problem. Being findable when someone searches your exact name is different from being recommended when someone asks for a solution. Most organizations are findable. Very few are recommendable.

When an investor asks AI 'Which lithium companies are structurally ready for 2026 production?' or a patient asks 'Who is the best orthopedic surgeon near me?', AI gives one answer or maybe three. If you are not in that answer, the person never visits your website, never calls, and never knows you exist. They proceed with whoever AI recommended. The Trust Triangle Framework, which evaluates Authority, Recommendability, and Citation, determines whether AI systems recommend you or your competitor."

AI authority is about whether AI systems like ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity trust your organization enough to recommend it by name during high stakes decision making moments. You can have a beautiful website with strong Google rankings and still be completely invisible to AI systems. Google ranks pages. AI systems evaluate entities, meaning people, organizations, and brands. The structural signals AI needs to recognize authority are different from what Google uses to rank web pages. An organization can rank on page one of Google and still return zero recognition across five AI platforms."

Authority means AI recognizes you as the verified expert in a specific field. Recommendability means your digital data signals trust, stability, and integrity. Citation means authoritative sources and publications reference you. Together, these three factors determine whether AI recommends you or your competitor when a stakeholder asks for data. Without all three, you are just another option in a list. With all three, you become the answer AI recommends with reasons why. The framework applies to any industry where AI driven due diligence affects capital allocation, partnership decisions, contract awards, or customer acquisition."

Phase 1 focuses on authority injection, ensuring AI systems can see who you are in every place they look first. Phase 2 focuses on ownership reinforcement, connecting your programs, properties, and assets back to your organizational identity. Phase 3 focuses on validation and stabilization, confirming that the corrections are holding across AI platforms. The process does not require new content creation, new platforms, advertising budgets, SEO campaigns, rebrands, or additional hires. It is editing, reorganizing, and standardizing existing assets so AI systems can read them as authority signals. Once built, structural authority compounds over time."

Healthcare, where patients increasingly use AI to choose providers. Professional services, where referrals now flow through AI recommendations. Organizations dependent on third party funding, where grant evaluators and sponsors use AI to verify credibility.

When a potential offtaker asks AI which lithium companies use sustainable DLE technology, the answer determines who gets the call and who does not. When a DOE evaluator uses AI to verify organizational credibility before contract decisions, the structural authority signals in your digital presence directly affect whether you are perceived as a reliable partner or an unknown entity. Every generic query where your organization is not the definitive answer is a missed signal to the stakeholders who control capital flow. Companies that are structurally invisible to AI systems are losing partnerships, funding opportunities, and contract awards they never know about."

Each platform has different architecture and different ways of sourcing information. The report tests what AI knows about your organization from its training data, what it can find when it actively searches, what real stakeholders are asking AI about your industry, and where your organization is or is not the recommended answer. Where platforms agree, that convergence strengthens the finding. Where they see different things, those divergences reveal nuances in how different systems categorize your organization. The report is a structural analysis and diagnostic, not a marketing plan. It identifies what must change at the system level before execution ever matters."

    <!-- ABOUT NICOLE -->

        <div class="max-w-[900px] mx-auto px-6">
            <h2 class="text-4xl md:text-5xl text-center text-[var(--primary-rust)] mb-12 font-black">Who Is Nicole Jolie. What I Do. How I Help You.</h2>
            <div class="text-lg text-gray-800 space-y-6">
                <p>I conduct Cross Platform AI Authority Reports for organizations in capital intensive industries that need to understand how AI systems currently evaluate them.</p>

                <p>Most organizations assume they are visible. Most are structurally invisible.</p>

                <p>AI systems like ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and Perplexity are increasingly how investors, partners, regulators, and customers verify credibility. When someone asks AI who leads lithium innovation in Arkansas, or who the best orthopedic surgeon is in their city, or which infrastructure partner is structurally ready for a contract, AI gives one answer. Maybe three. If you are not in that answer, you are losing opportunities you will never know about.</p>

                <div class="about-highlight">
                    <p class="font-bold text-[var(--primary-rust)]">My reports diagnose where AI recognizes you and where it does not. Where trust signals break. Which revenue impacting queries you are missing. And what structural changes are required to become the recommended source.</p>
                </div>

                <p>I spent over 20 years building digital systems for high stakes industries. I watched capital intensive organizations start becoming invisible because their data was not structured for the way AI systems evaluate authority. This is not about marketing. This is about whether AI systems trust your organization enough to recommend it when the stakes are high.</p>

                <p>The Trust Triangle Framework (Authority, Recommendability, and Citation) defines what AI systems evaluate when deciding who to recommend. My methodology tests across five major AI platforms to map exactly where an organization stands and what needs to change.</p>

                <p>This is not SEO. I diagnose whether your expertise is being trusted at the system level. Not to convince you that the system exists, but to show you exactly where it sees you, where it does not, and what to do about it.</p>

                <p class="font-bold">If you are ready to stop being invisible and become the authority AI cites, start with your Authority Roadmap.</p>

        <div class="max-w-[900px] mx-auto px-6">
            <h2 class="text-4xl md:text-5xl text-center text-[var(--primary-rust)] mb-16 font-black">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            <div class="faq-container">

                <div class="faq-item" onclick="this.classList.toggle('active')">
                    <div class="faq-question">How do I know if AI search engines can find my company? <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">The simplest test is to ask ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, or Gemini about your industry without using your company name. Ask something like "Who is the leading provider of [your service] in [your area]?" If your company does not appear in the answer, or if your competitor appears instead of you, you have a structural visibility problem. Being findable when someone searches your exact name is different from being recommended when someone asks for a solution. A Cross Platform AI Authority Report tests this systematically across five major AI platforms.</div>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item" onclick="this.classList.toggle('active')">
                    <div class="faq-question">What is the difference between being listed and being recommended? <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Being listed means AI can find you when someone searches your exact name. Being recommended means AI suggests you when someone asks for a solution to a problem and explains why you are the best choice. When an investor asks AI "Which companies are structurally ready for 2026?" or a patient asks "Who is the best surgeon near me?", AI gives one answer or maybe three. If you are not in that answer, the person never visits your website, never calls, and never knows you exist. They proceed with whoever AI recommended.</div>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item" onclick="this.classList.toggle('active')">
                    <div class="faq-question">Is AI search optimization the same as SEO? <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">No. They are fundamentally different. SEO ranks web pages in Google's list of ten blue links using keywords and backlinks. AI authority determines whether AI systems trust your organization enough to recommend it by name. You can rank on page one of Google and still return zero recognition across five AI platforms. Google ranks pages. AI evaluates entities. Different system. Different signals. Different outcome.</div>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item" onclick="this.classList.toggle('active')">
                    <div class="faq-question">What is the Trust Triangle? <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">The Trust Triangle is a framework for understanding how AI search engines decide who to recommend. It has three elements: Authority (AI recognizes you as the verified expert), Recommendability (your digital signals indicate trust and stability), and Citation (authoritative sources reference you). Together, these determine whether AI recommends you or your competitor. Without all three, you are just another option. With all three, you become the answer AI recommends with reasons why.</div>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item" onclick="this.classList.toggle('active')">
                    <div class="faq-question">How long does it take to build AI authority? <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">This is infrastructure, not overnight marketing. The typical structural correction process takes 90 days. It does not require new content creation, new platforms, advertising, SEO campaigns, rebrands, or additional hires. It is editing, reorganizing, and standardizing existing assets so AI systems can read them as authority signals. Once built, structural authority compounds over time.</div>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item" onclick="this.classList.toggle('active')">
                    <div class="faq-question">What is an AI Authority Report? <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">A Cross Platform AI Authority Report is a systematic audit across five major AI platforms: ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity, and Manus. It reveals what AI knows about your organization, what it can find when it searches, what stakeholders are asking AI about your industry, and where you are or are not the recommended answer. The report is a structural analysis and diagnostic. It identifies what must change at the system level before execution ever matters.</div>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item" onclick="this.classList.toggle('active')">
                    <div class="faq-question">What industries benefit most from AI Authority Reports? <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Any industry where AI driven due diligence affects capital allocation, partnership decisions, contract awards, or customer acquisition. The highest value verticals include energy and infrastructure (capital intensive, stakeholder verification critical), healthcare (patients using AI to choose providers), professional services (referrals flowing through AI), and organizations dependent on third party funding (grant evaluators using AI to verify credibility).</div>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item" onclick="this.classList.toggle('active')">
                    <div class="faq-question">Can AI really affect my revenue? <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i></div>
                    <div class="faq-answer">Yes. When investors, partners, or customers ask AI systems for recommendations and your competitor appears instead of you, you lose opportunities you never know about. They never visit your website. They never call. They proceed with whoever AI recommended. Every generic query where your organization is not the definitive answer is a missed signal to the stakeholders who control capital flow.</div>
