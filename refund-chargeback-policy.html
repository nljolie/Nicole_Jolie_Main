NO REFUND POLICY
Nicole Jolie and Worthy of Success, LLC operates under a strict NO REFUND NO CHARGEBACK policy for all consulting services, digital products, and educational materials. Unless otherwise specifically stated on the website or in contract, we will not allow refunds or chargebacks for our services.  Where stated that there is a refund policy, after paying for services you have 72 hours from receipt of payment to withdrawal your payment.  All work commences 72 hours AFTER your payment, not before.  We reserve the right to wait until your payment is thoroughly processed and there are no refunds or chargebacks after we commence service work as per the agreement you entered into with us unless otherwise stated.

Any materials or resources delivered
DIGITAL PRODUCTS
All digital products, including but not limited to:
Generative Engine Optimization Score assessments
Educational materials

COLLABORATIVE CONSULTING NATURE
Our services are provided on a collaborative basis where success depends entirely on the CLIENT'S implementation, effort, and consistency. We cannot refund services when results depend on factors outside our control.
