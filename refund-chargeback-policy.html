                    <p>All consulting services from Be Socially Smashing LLC are provided on a "build-with-your-tools" basis. This means YOU purchase, own, and maintain all third-party software, platforms, and services required for implementation.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>What You Must Purchase and Own:</strong></p>

                    <h2>CONSULTING SERVICES - INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY DELIVERY</h2>
                    
                    <p>All consulting services provided by Be Socially Smashing LLC involve the immediate transfer of intellectual property, proprietary methodologies, strategic insights, and expert recommendations.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Intellectual Property Cannot Be Returned</strong></p>
                    
                    <p>Unlike physical products that can be shipped back, intellectual property delivered during consulting sessions cannot be "returned" once shared with you. This includes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>AI search optimization strategies and frameworks</li>
                        <li>Proprietary Trust Triangle methodology (Authority, Recommendability, Citation)</li>

                    <p><strong>Ownership Transfer</strong></p>
                    
                    <p>Upon payment and service delivery, all intellectual property, strategies, frameworks, and recommendations provided to you become YOUR property. You receive full ownership and rights to implement, use, and benefit from all consulting insights delivered.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Acknowledgment of Non-Returnable Nature</strong></p>
                    
                    <p>You acknowledge that once you have received consulting advice, strategic insights, proprietary methodologies, or expert recommendations, these remain in your possession and knowledge regardless of whether you choose to implement them or achieve specific results.</p>
                    
                    <h2>INFORMED DECISION-MAKING PROCESS</h2>
                    
                    <p>Before any payment is accepted, all prospective clients complete a thorough screening and discovery process that includes:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>Free initial consultation or discovery call to discuss needs and expectations</li>
                        <li>Clear explanation of services, deliverables, and realistic timelines</li>
                        <li>Review of our AI search optimization methodology and approach</li>
                        <li>Opportunity to ask questions and clarify scope of work</li>
                        <li>Full transparency about what is and is not included in services</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>By proceeding with payment after this screening process, you confirm:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You understand the full scope of services being purchased</li>
                        <li>You have had the opportunity to ask all questions</li>
                        <li>You have realistic expectations about timelines and results</li>
                        <li>You are making an informed decision to proceed</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h2>REALISTIC TIMELINE EXPECTATIONS</h2>
                    
                    <p>AI search optimization and business discoverability improvements take time. Results from our consulting services typically require a minimum of 21-30 days to begin appearing, and often take 60-90 days for substantial impact.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Why Results Take Time:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity must crawl and index your updated content</li>
                        <li>Search engine algorithms require time to recognize and rank new optimizations</li>
                        <li>Content authority and trust signals build gradually, not overnight</li>
                        <li>Implementation of recommendations requires consistent effort over weeks and months</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p><strong>What You Can Expect:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Weekly progress updates and ongoing support during the optimization process</li>
                        <li>Gradual improvements in AI search visibility over time</li>
                        <li>Strategic guidance and course corrections as needed</li>
                        <li>Documentation of changes and their expected impact</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p><strong>What We Cannot Control:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The exact timeline for LLM crawlers to index your site</li>
                        <li>Third-party platform algorithm changes</li>
                        <li>Your implementation speed and consistency</li>
                        <li>External market factors affecting search visibility</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>By purchasing consulting services, you acknowledge that results depend on multiple factors including your implementation effort, consistency over time, and factors outside our direct control.</p>
                    
                    <h2>NO REFUNDS FOR ANY REASON</h2>

                    <ul>

                        <li>Changes in business priorities or direction</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>The value of consulting services lies in the intellectual property, expertise, and strategic insights delivered—not in guaranteed outcomes or specific results.</p>

                        <li>Dissatisfaction with results, failure to implement recommendations, change of mind, or unmet expectations are NOT valid grounds for chargebacks</li>
                        <li>You participated in a free screening process and made an informed decision to purchase services</li>
                    </ol>
